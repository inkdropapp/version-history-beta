- Duplicate menu items in the Trash notebook (Thanks [Dmitry](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/duplicate-items-in-the-context-menu/3599/5?u=craftzdog))

### Embed the default preview theme in the app

In v5.8.1, the app would solve the following issue by embedding the default preview theme:

- GFM Alerts not working on community preview themes (Thanks [Kentaro and taichi](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/there-might-be-a-bug-in-rendering-alerts/4529)

The problem is that themes have to provide every style, which requires to update when the app gets a new feature with a stylesheet.
Since we can't expect every theme developer to sustainably and quickly update their themes, it'd be nice to have the default styles instead of requiring the themes to include every style.
So, from this version, themes basically 'override' the default theme.

https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-github-preview-theme

The default preview theme `github-preview` now doesn't apply any styles.
If you create a new preview theme, you only have to add styles for customizations.

This way, the existing preview themes can continue working without updating, like GFM Alerts.

In the future, I'll make the same change to the UI themes.

## Improvements

### Update the GitHub preview theme to match the latest GitHub styles

The default preview theme was outdated, so it has been updated based on [this reopsitory](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).
This also fixes the task list identation issue (Thanks [Dmitry](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/no-text-indentation-in-checklist-preview/4536)).

### Apply the syntax theme to codeblocks in the Markdown preview (Needs update)

While working on simplifying theming the Markdown preview styles mentioned above, I thought it'd be nice to support applying the current syntax theme to the codeblocks in the preview pane automatically.
It allows you to avoid making another preview theme just for changing the codeblock syntax highlighting styles.

For example: Solarized Dark

Solarized Light:

#### How to make your syntax theme support it

The Markdown renderer now adds a class name `.codeblock` to the enclosing `div` elements of the codeblocks.
So, it is easy to add styles to them just by adding a CSS selector `.mde-preview .codeblock pre` to your stylesheet like so:

```diff
diff --git a/styles/index.css b/styles/index.css
index 14ae539..3f6bcbb 100644
--- a/styles/index.css
+++ b/styles/index.css
@@ -26,7 +26,8 @@ http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/img/solarized-palette.png
   --base-magenta: #d33682;

   /* Color scheme for code-mirror */
-  .CodeMirror {
+  .CodeMirror,
+  .mde-preview .codeblock pre {
     color-scheme: dark;

     color: var(--base05);
     .cm-header {
       color: var(--base-yellow);
     }
```

### Better Preferences UI

The setting items have been organized and it has got much easier to find and change settings.

And the Plugins page has got a filter input:

### New editor option: "Paste URL as link"

Some people don't like the feature (Thanks [Ryota](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/how-disable-auto-link-title/4558)).

- **Preferences** -> **Editing** -> **Markdown** -> **Paste URL as link**
