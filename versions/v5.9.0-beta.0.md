## üîé The full-text search engine is now language-agnostic

> [!NOTE]
> This is the same update on [mobile v5.4.0](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/inkdrop-mobile-v5-4-0-ground-up-improvements/4975)

This update would solve this issue: [Odd searching issue when searching for text](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/odd-searching-issue-when-searching-for-text/4477)

The app had been using the language-dependent tokenization processes called [Porter stemming algorithm](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/) and a Japanese-specific segmentation algorithm.
In some cases, they cause some odd searching issue, where [you can't find notes with particular keywords](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/odd-searching-issue-when-searching-for-text/4477).

I recently found that SQLite3 officially supports [the trigram tokenizer](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/odd-searching-issue-when-searching-for-text/4477/3?u=craftzdog).
I managed to migrate to it. Now, you can use any languages including Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, etc., in your notes!
Also, it fully supports partial matching, so it is optimal for searching code snippets.
For example, it can properly find a note with a code fragment like `"er } = require("`.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Highlight matched keywords in the note list

As you can see in the above screenshot, it now can highlight matched keyworeds in the note list, which would help you more quickly find your desired note.

## Improvements

- feat(context-menu): add 'Paste as Plain Text' to the editor context menu
