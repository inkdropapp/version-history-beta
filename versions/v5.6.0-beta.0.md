## üí® Faster launch speed

Managed to make it 500-700ms faster üöÄ

Here is a demo:

### Loading plugins lazily

Along with v5.6.0, some plugins have been updated with performance improvements as well. [mermaid](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/mermaid) and [math](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/math) load their modules only when you open a note that uses one of them. It would keep the launch speed fast even if you installed plugins that require massive modules like them.

## üé® Markdown renderer engine update

v5.6.0 has upgraded Remark and Rehype packages to the latest versions. It isn't only an internal improvement but also gives you more possibilities to get useful features. It now has `mdast` and `hast` data in [the preview state](https://developers.inkdrop.app/states/preview), which allows to add syntax-aware features like outline views more easily without relying on regular expressions.

On the other hand, it may cause some plugins not working due to the breaking changes. For plugin developers, I'll post another topic to help you update your plugins.

## üåà Built-in paste-as-markdown support

Plugins are useful but it'd be a burden to explore and decide which plugins to install for light users. I wanted to make the app just work out of the box. As a starter, `paste-as-markdown` is now bundled into the app by default. It allows you to paste HTML as Markdown from the clipboard. It'd be useful for copy-and-pasting formatted texts from browsers.

I'm planning to bundle **Mermaid**, **GitHub Emoji**, and **Math** plugins as well.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bump up Electron to 25.1.1

Expected some platform-dependent issues to be fixed with this release.

### üòµ Acrylic window style is not working on Windows

* https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/lag-when-resizing-the-window-with-acrylic-background/4011

On Electron@25.1.1, the module that the app used to support the acrylic window style no longer works, unfortunately. The good news is that Electron itself officially supports the acrylic style for Windows:

https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38163

The bad news is that it is not stable and working as expected ‚Äì It doesn't work with frameless windows, besides, it becomes unresizable and loses shadows. So, unfortunately, the acrylic window style is not supported on Windows in this release. Maybe I should stop supporting such an unstable feature üò≠

## ‚ú® New API documentation (WIP)

I've been working on redesigning the documentation and the new API documentation is now available as WIP.

https://developers.inkdrop.app/

The design is heavily inspired by Stripe, built on top of Tailwind UI. It supports full-text search now. There are still many missing pages and broken links though, your help to improve the doc would be greatly appreciated. It will be more comprehensive and easy to understand and I hope you like it :D

I'll be working on creating a new user manual as well!
