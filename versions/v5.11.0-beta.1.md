## Big launch speed improvement for Windows

It addresses the following reported issue:

- [17 seconds cold start on Windows 10](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/17-seconds-cold-start-on-windows-10/5143)

This was due to Windows Defender scanning the app's resource files on startup.
I've managed to bundle all the files into a single ASAR file including the native modules to reduce the scanning time.
It now starts up in ~3 seconds on my machine.

Thanks for helping me identify the cause of the issue, @Micha_Huhn, @Magnus, and @Lukas!

## Reduced app size by ~120MB

There is a good side-effect of optimizing the app's build process -- the app size has been significantly reduced!

- macOS app size:
  - v5.11.0-beta.0: **542.1MB**
  - v5.11.0-beta.1: **419.9MB**
