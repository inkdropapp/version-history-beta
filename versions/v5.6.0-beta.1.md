## âœ¨ Nested workspace views
In previous versions, pressing the "Detail" button on the notebook would take you to the workspace view, but you couldn't press the "Detail" button again once you were in that view.
In this update, the "Detail" button is now functional within the workspace view as well!

The sidebar now displays the path of the current and parent notebooks:

## Bug fixes
- Can't change tag colors (Thanks [Lukas](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/changing-the-color-of-a-tag-fails/4107))
- Defer updating the preview a bit longer when the preview is not visible (Thanks [Seito](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/keystrokes-are-slow-in-the-beta-version/4122/5))
- When exporting, use `Untitled` if the note title is empty
- Different modules like `react` get loaded from an incorrect path, which causes the app to crash (Thanks [Jaime](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/math-plugin-not-working-nor-found/4130))
- The cursor jumps to a wrong position when toggling the side-by-side mode
- The app crashes when uninstalling a plugin from Preferences (Thanks [Lukas](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/inkdrop-crashes-when-i-uninstall-a-plugin/4141/))
- The note counts are not updated correctly in the workspace views (Thanks [SDO](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/status-not-updating-for-subnotebook-notes-in-focused-notebook/4151))
- `open()` does not open the url in a browser but opens it in an internal browser window instead (Thanks [Shimizu](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/v5-6-how-to-use-an-external-browser-with-the-open-method/4145))
- Sidebar display all notes after toggling off a distraction free (Thanks [Bundit](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/sidebar-display-all-notes-after-toggling-off-a-distraction-free/4111))

## API
I've been preparing to support the command palette feature. A new API for it is available on `CommandRegistry`. You can use it like so:

```js
inkdrop.commands.findCommands({target: document.querySelector('.CodeMirror')})
```
