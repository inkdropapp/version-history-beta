# Inkdrop Release Notes (Beta)

## v5.9.0-beta.0
2024-09-25

## üîé The full-text search engine is now language-agnostic

> [!NOTE]
> This is the same update on [mobile v5.4.0](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/inkdrop-mobile-v5-4-0-ground-up-improvements/4975)

This update would solve this issue: [Odd searching issue when searching for text](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/odd-searching-issue-when-searching-for-text/4477)

The app had been using the language-dependent tokenization processes called [Porter stemming algorithm](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/) and a Japanese-specific segmentation algorithm.
In some cases, they cause some odd searching issue, where [you can't find notes with particular keywords](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/odd-searching-issue-when-searching-for-text/4477).

I recently found that SQLite3 officially supports [the trigram tokenizer](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/odd-searching-issue-when-searching-for-text/4477/3?u=craftzdog).
I managed to migrate to it. Now, you can use any languages including Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, etc., in your notes!
Also, it fully supports partial matching, so it is optimal for searching code snippets.
For example, it can properly find a note with a code fragment like `"er } = require("`.

![trigram-demo](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:1gCh5Ch8/index-public)

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Highlight matched keywords in the note list

![highlight-matched-keywords](inkdrop://file:rOo4VOJN)

As you can see in the above screenshot, it now can highlight matched keyworeds in the note list, which would help you more quickly find your desired note.

## Improvements

- feat(context-menu): add 'Paste as Plain Text' to the editor context menu
  ![Paste as Plain Text context menu #x-small](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:nF_3MZmI/index-public)

## Bug fixes

- fix(theme): Cannot enable Vibrant dark theme on the light mode on the system (Thanks [SDO and Marco](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/can-not-enable-vibrant-dark-theme/4595))
- fix(redux): prevent performing some actions on the non-existing notebooks (Thanks [Akiya-san](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/when-i-open-it-in-the-windows-version-its-all-dark/4612)
  - Prevent opening another note when failing to save the current note
  - Prevent creating a new note in the notebook that does not exist

- fix(preferences-plugins): Blank screen from search on filter of Installed plugins (Thanks [Bundit](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/blank-screen-from-search-on-filter-of-installed-plugins/4605))

## v5.8.1-beta.2
2024-04-23

## Bugfixes

- mde: custom font family not being applied (Thanks [Shimizu-san](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/the-font-family-is-not-reflected-5-8-1-beta-1/4565))
- dev-tools: Copy tag id from sidebar throws an error (Thanks [Lukas](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/plugin-dev-tools-copy-tag-id-from-sidebar-throws-an-error/4570))
- Do not enable the 'Readable Line Length' option by default (Thanks [Shimizu-san](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/readable-line-length-option-is-not-accepted/4569))

## Improvements

- Avoid triggering **Auto link title** when the cursor is in the middle of the link
  - For example, when you type `[link title](|` (`|` is the cursor position) and hit <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl-V</kbd>, it shouldn't trigger the paste-as-link dialog.

## Internal changes

### Adopting Cascade Layers

[Cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) would make theming much simpler.
They allow themes to avoid rule specificity issues.
Inkdrop will bundle more default styles in the future versions, and with cascade layers, custom themes will only need to override the default styles rather than including every style.

UI, syntax, and preview themes are automatically enclosed with the corresponding cascade layers in v5.8.1.
The order of precedence is defined as the following at the moment:

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, theme, theme.ui, theme.preview, theme.syntax;
```

- `reset`: Reset styles
- `base`: The app base styles
- `tokens`: CSS common variables
- `theme.ui`: UI theme
- `theme.preview`: Preview theme
- `theme.syntax`: Syntax theme

### Others

- Remove the reset CSS styles from UI theme stylesheets automatically when loading
- üêõ Focus rings not working on some components
  - Changed the cascading layer to `@layer theme.ui`

## v5.8.1-beta.1
2024-04-19

## Bug fixes

- Wrong icon in 'Apps and Features' list on Windows (Thanks [Dmitry](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/default-electron-icon-in-apps-and-features-list/4548))
- Scroll positions get reset when changing the layout (Thanks [Ivan](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/keep-the-edit-location-when-toggle-side-bar/4545))
- Random crashes when quitting Inkdrop on Windows (Thanks [Patrick](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/error-on-closing-inkdrop-on-win-11/4561))
- The 'Create' button does nothing on the Paste URL as Link dialog (Thanks [Patrick](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/paste-of-url-does-nothing-on-hitting-create/4559))
- Duplicate menu items in the Trash notebook (Thanks [Dmitry](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/duplicate-items-in-the-context-menu/3599/5?u=craftzdog))

### Embed the default preview theme in the app

In v5.8.1, the app would solve the following issue by embedding the default preview theme:

- GFM Alerts not working on community preview themes (Thanks [Kentaro and taichi](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/there-might-be-a-bug-in-rendering-alerts/4529)

The problem is that themes have to provide every style, which requires to update when the app gets a new feature with a stylesheet.
Since we can't expect every theme developer to sustainably and quickly update their themes, it'd be nice to have the default styles instead of requiring the themes to include every style.
So, from this version, themes basically 'override' the default theme.

https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-github-preview-theme

The default preview theme `github-preview` now doesn't apply any styles.
If you create a new preview theme, you only have to add styles for customizations.

This way, the existing preview themes can continue working without updating, like GFM Alerts.

In the future, I'll make the same change to the UI themes.

## Improvements

### Update the GitHub preview theme to match the latest GitHub styles

The default preview theme was outdated, so it has been updated based on [this reopsitory](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).
This also fixes the task list identation issue (Thanks [Dmitry](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/no-text-indentation-in-checklist-preview/4536)).

### Apply the syntax theme to codeblocks in the Markdown preview (Needs update)

While working on simplifying theming the Markdown preview styles mentioned above, I thought it'd be nice to support applying the current syntax theme to the codeblocks in the preview pane automatically.
It allows you to avoid making another preview theme just for changing the codeblock syntax highlighting styles.

For example: Solarized Dark

![Solarized Dark](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:-9cyFnTmz/index-public)

Solarized Light:

![Solarized Light](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:1Weo0dhfD/index-public)

#### How to make your syntax theme support it

The Markdown renderer now adds a class name `.codeblock` to the enclosing `div` elements of the codeblocks.
So, it is easy to add styles to them just by adding a CSS selector `.mde-preview .codeblock pre` to your stylesheet like so:

```diff
diff --git a/styles/index.css b/styles/index.css
index 14ae539..3f6bcbb 100644
--- a/styles/index.css
+++ b/styles/index.css
@@ -26,7 +26,8 @@ http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/img/solarized-palette.png
   --base-magenta: #d33682;

   /* Color scheme for code-mirror */
-  .CodeMirror {
+  .CodeMirror,
+  .mde-preview .codeblock pre {
     color-scheme: dark;

     color: var(--base05);
     .cm-header {
       color: var(--base-yellow);
     }
```

Check out [Solarized Dark Syntax](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-solarized-dark-syntax-theme) for more detail.

### Better Preferences UI

The setting items have been organized and it has got much easier to find and change settings.

![Better setting UIs](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:2HqnvlOPy/index-public)

And the Plugins page has got a filter input:

![Filter installed plugins with keyword](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:ksYfsq6pr/index-public)

### New editor option: "Paste URL as link"

Some people don't like the feature (Thanks [Ryota](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/how-disable-auto-link-title/4558)).

- **Preferences** -> **Editing** -> **Markdown** -> **Paste URL as link**

![Preferences](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:7bFuyciCn/index-public)

## v5.8.0-beta.2
2024-03-15

## Revisiting the editor drawer

In v5.8.0-beta.1, the backlinks have been added to the editor drawer.
But as [picklecillo pointed out](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/making-the-editor-drawer-permanently-available/4486), you may want to make it persistent so that you can jump around the linked notes quickly.

First, I considered adding another dropdown for backlinks next to the notebook name under the note title.
But I thought it wouldn't be useful if you want to check backlinks across multiple notes sequentially.
I found myself rarely opening the editor drawer to check the note information.
It should be solely used for additional actions like ‚ÄòRevision history‚Äô, ‚ÄòShare on web‚Äô, ‚ÄòPin to top‚Äô, etc, that‚Äôs simple and easy to understand.
Instead of adding various things to the editor drawer and making it complicated, it‚Äôd be nice to display the note metadata and backlinks in the preview.

So, I decided to render the note information in the preview as a part of the note, as you can see below:

![Metadata rendered in the preview](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:YInbeS2wd/index-public)

This way, you can quickly check the metadata without toggling the editor drawer while it doesn‚Äôt distract your writing experience.

The backlink section can be folded. The app remembers the fold/unfold state across notes.

![fold/unfold the backlink section](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:Ou6mihANI/index-public)

The scroll sync still works just fine:

![scroll sync](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:WWPL0i2SU/index-public)

## New option: Readable line lengths

This option limits the maximum width of the editor and preview panes to prevent excessively long lines of text. Enabled by default.

![New option](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:VUNwrLDtR/index-public)

## Bugfixes

- fix(macOS): Full Screen Button Disable Problem ([Thanks Tahsin](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/full-screen-button-disable-problem/4474))
- fix(note-list): Inconsistent tag filtering ([Thanks Lukas](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/inconsistent-tag-filtering/4480))
- fix(editor): Auto link title: does not properly check whether only exactly one link is inserted ([Thanks Lukas](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/auto-link-title-does-not-properly-check-whether-only-exactly-one-link-is-inserted/4479))

## v5.8.0-beta.1
2024-03-08

I'm excited to announce v5.8.0-beta.1, which has got so many improvements and new features!

## Inter-note workflow improvements

v5.8.0 works much more efficiently in connecting your notes.

### üÜï Backlinks

If you connect your notes with internal links, you may want this feature. It now supports displaying which notes have links to the current editing note on the editor drawer.

[![v5-8-0_backlinks](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:nyeS7KLdE/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:nyeS7KLdE/index-public)

With backlinks, you can quickly jump around related notes.

### Tip: Wiki-style link creations

If you are used to writing Wiki, do you know Inkdrop supports creating placeholder links? It is simple. Just write a link without an URI!

```
- [Link title]()
```

Then, click it on the preview pane and it will create a new note with the title. As of v5.8.0, it automatically updates link titles in the note when you change the note title.

### üÜï Create a new note from the selection

When debugging a bug, you sometimes find another issue to solve as your investigation goes deeper. You already took some notes on the new issue. Inkdrop doesn't block your concentration by allowing you to create a new note from the selection.

First, select the text and right-click it on the editor:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_01](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eQzNYZaJV/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eQzNYZaJV/index-public)

A dialog shows up, then input a note title:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:iREk41NjW/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:iREk41NjW/index-public)

Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and you get a new note with the selected text.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_03](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:m-WMQ5F9a/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:m-WMQ5F9a/index-public)As you can see, you already have a backlink from the source note. You can click it to go back.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_04](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:qS5q_-EaZ/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:qS5q_-EaZ/index-public)

The selected text is replaced with a link to the new note.

- New command:
  - `core:new-note-from-selection`

### üôå Remember the scroll positions

When writing a note while referring to other notes, it was frustrating to always get the cursor and scroll positions to be reset when going back to the note. In order to help you work with multiple notes efficiently, v5.8.0 now remembers the cursor and scroll positions in the navigation history.

In the above example, when clicking a backlink, the cursor position is already where the new link is created.

## Navigation improvements

### ü´° Preserve the note list order when clicking a tag on the note list item

The tag labels on the note list allow you to click to filter by a tag, which is handy to quickly narrow down to a specific topic on the list. By design, it was using the full-text search feature internally, which always changed the sort order to 'Best match'. It looked strange as you just intended to filter the current notes, but not to search with keywords, so the list sort order should be preserved. As of v5.8.0, it now properly preserves the sort order when filtering by a tag.

For example, some notes are tagged with 'v5.8.0'. Currently, the note list displays all the notes in a workspace of the notebook 'Inkdrop', ordered by last modification dates in descending order. You want to filter notes by the tag by clicking it on the note list item.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_preserve-note-list-sort-order_01](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eI86r2uX4/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eI86r2uX4/index-public)

Then, the note list displays only notes with the tag 'v5.8.0'. Before, it changed the order to 'Best Match'. As of v5.8.0, it preserves the sort order, which is the last modification date in the descending order in this example.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_preserve-note-list-sort-order_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:zFSW1sX2o/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:zFSW1sX2o/index-public)

You can of course change the order from the dropdown menu on the note list header bar anytime.

### 'Go to Workspace' context menu

When you are checking notes in the 'All Notes' on the sidebar, you may feel like quickly jumping into a workspace view of the viewing note. You could open a notebook but it now also lets you go to the workspace view from the context menu of the notebook dropdown menu on the editor:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_go-to-workspace](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:PzVbjS52Z/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:PzVbjS52Z/index-public)

But what about nested notebooks? Let's say, you see a note in the child notebook, but you want to go to the workspace of the parent notebook. No worries. After selecting the 'Go to Workspace' context menu, the focus moves to the sidebar. Then, you can hit <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to go up to the parent workspace.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_go-to-workspace_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:9ljmf5sQR/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:9ljmf5sQR/index-public)

It is helpful to quickly switch between projects.

- New commands:
  - `editor:go-to-workspace-of-editing-note`
  - `core:sidebar-workspace-go-up`

## Editor improvements

### üîî Markdown Alerts syntax support

Recently, GitHub officially supports [Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). It is a simple extension of Markdown, which allows you to insert 'alerts' a.k.a. admonitions or callouts. For example:

```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is currently a work in progress, expect things to be broken!
```

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_gfm-alerts_01](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:c6cvtAUIq/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:c6cvtAUIq/index-public)

Inkdrop now supports these alerts, too!

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_gfm-alerts_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:wElcnzkli/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:wElcnzkli/index-public)

You don't have to remember the syntax. The editor toolbar has got a button for alerts here.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_gfm-alerts_03](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:7wg_OIJCm/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:7wg_OIJCm/index-public)

- New commands:
  - `core:insert-alert-note`
  - `core:insert-alert-tip`
  - `core:insert-alert-important`
  - `core:insert-alert-warning`
  - `core:insert-alert-caution`

### üîó Auto link title

Links are crucial for tech note-taking since you often need to refer to external information from your notes.

I've been using John's [paste-url](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/paste-url) plugin to paste URLs as a Markdown link. In this release, I'm happy that it is now officially supported!

For example, you are referring to a bug report on the GitHub repository and you'd like to mention it in your note. You can copy the URL from the browser and paste it in the editor, then a dialog shows up:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_auto-link-title](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gD2U5mzPv/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gD2U5mzPv/index-public)

The app automatically fetches the page title of the given URL. You can choose a link format with up/down arrow keys. It can correctly extract the page title even if the website doesn't support server-side rendering, which is nice.

## UI design improvements

### üßê Focus outlines

I wanted to improve a small but fundamental thing - focus indicators. Since some input components like buttons and the search bar didn't have proper focus outlines, you couldn't tell where the current focus is. This improvement makes you a bit more comfortable to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus around.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_focus-outlines](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:ezfusyqt8/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:ezfusyqt8/index-public)

### üîñ Better tag appearances for the dark UI theme

The tag colors were too vibrant when you were on the dark UI theme. As a big fan of using tags, I wanted to make them look more unified for it.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_tag-redesign-for-dark](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gxKqYycRI/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gxKqYycRI/index-public)

## ‚ú® Nested workspace views
In previous versions, pressing the "Detail" button on the notebook would take you to the workspace view, but you couldn't press the "Detail" button again once you were in that view.
In this update, the "Detail" button is now functional within the workspace view as well!

![nested workspace view](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70deb1d54021785330b8ff881f949ac253e9c37a.jpeg)

The sidebar now displays the path of the current and parent notebooks:

![nested workspace view 2](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4d01ce272032530449d11aa068cd52c488f928b.jpeg)

## Bug fixes
- Can't change tag colors (Thanks [Lukas](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/changing-the-color-of-a-tag-fails/4107))
- Defer updating the preview a bit longer when the preview is not visible (Thanks [Seito](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/keystrokes-are-slow-in-the-beta-version/4122/5))
- When exporting, use `Untitled` if the note title is empty
- Different modules like `react` get loaded from an incorrect path, which causes the app to crash (Thanks [Jaime](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/math-plugin-not-working-nor-found/4130))
- The cursor jumps to a wrong position when toggling the side-by-side mode

## API
I've been preparing to support the command palette feature. A new API for it is available on `CommandRegistry`. You can use it like so:

```js
inkdrop.commands.findCommands({target: document.querySelector('.CodeMirror')})
```

## v5.6.0-beta.0
2023-08-29

## üí® Faster launch speed

Managed to make it 500-700ms faster üöÄ

Here is a demo:

![file_Gs-9UL_8u|433x500](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0c3f975cfc231e951ba923fc4d86c959cd116295.gif)

**‚úçÔ∏è STORY**: [How I made Inkdrop 500ms faster to launchüöÄ](https://www.devas.life/how-i-made-inkdrop-500ms-faster-to-launch/)

### Loading plugins lazily

Along with v5.6.0, some plugins have been updated with performance improvements as well. [mermaid](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/mermaid) and [math](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/math) load their modules only when you open a note that uses one of them. It would keep the launch speed fast even if you installed plugins that require massive modules like them.

## üé® Markdown renderer engine update

v5.6.0 has upgraded Remark and Rehype packages to the latest versions. It isn't only an internal improvement but also gives you more possibilities to get useful features. It now has `mdast` and `hast` data in [the preview state](https://developers.inkdrop.app/states/preview), which allows to add syntax-aware features like outline views more easily without relying on regular expressions.

**‚úçÔ∏è STORY**: [Refactoring the extensible Markdown renderer üõ†Ô∏è](https://www.devas.life/refactoring-the-extensible-markdown-renderer/)

On the other hand, it may cause some plugins not working due to the breaking changes. For plugin developers, I'll post another topic to help you update your plugins.

## üåà Built-in paste-as-markdown support

Plugins are useful but it'd be a burden to explore and decide which plugins to install for light users. I wanted to make the app just work out of the box. As a starter, `paste-as-markdown` is now bundled into the app by default. It allows you to paste HTML as Markdown from the clipboard. It'd be useful for copy-and-pasting formatted texts from browsers.

I'm planning to bundle **Mermaid**, **GitHub Emoji**, and **Math** plugins as well.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bump up Electron to 25.1.1

Expected some platform-dependent issues to be fixed with this release.

* https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/showopendialog-opens-behind-the-app-on-linux/3972/3

### üòµ Acrylic window style is not working on Windows

* https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/lag-when-resizing-the-window-with-acrylic-background/4011

On Electron@25.1.1, the module that the app used to support the acrylic window style no longer works, unfortunately. The good news is that Electron itself officially supports the acrylic style for Windows:

https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38163

The bad news is that it is not stable and working as expected ‚Äì It doesn't work with frameless windows, besides, it becomes unresizable and loses shadows. So, unfortunately, the acrylic window style is not supported on Windows in this release. Maybe I should stop supporting such an unstable feature üò≠

## ‚ú® New API documentation (WIP)

I've been working on redesigning the documentation and the new API documentation is now available as WIP.

https://developers.inkdrop.app/

The design is heavily inspired by Stripe, built on top of Tailwind UI. It supports full-text search now. There are still many missing pages and broken links though, your help to improve the doc would be greatly appreciated. It will be more comprehensive and easy to understand and I hope you like it :D

I'll be working on creating a new user manual as well!

## Other bug fixes and improvements

* **improvement(note-list)**: The sidebar now has the "Pinned Notes" section. In "All Notes", pinned notes are no longer displayed on top of the note list.
